Simple raytracer in c++

Its important to note that any changes to the scenery must be changed directly in the code, images will be saved in the downloads folder of the user by the name of user, aditional changes to the path must be done manually. This raytracer supports only planes and spheres at the moment and I am not planning to add anything else.
